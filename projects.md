### [zkPoD](https://github.com/sec-bit/zkPoD-node)

A decentralized system for data exchange. See our [technical paper](https://sec-bit.github.io/zkPoD-node/paper.pdf) for more information.

### [CKB-ZKP (a.k.a. zkp-toolkit-ckb)](https://github.com/sec-bit/ckb-zkp)

Zero-knowledge proofs toolkit for CKB. Under active development and selected as one of the first infrastructure projects to be funded by the [Nervos Ecosystem Grants Program](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/three-new-ecosystem-grants-awarded-892b97e8bc06). Read the original proposal [here](https://talk.nervos.org/t/secbit-labs-zkp-toolkit-ckb-a-zero-knowledge-proof-toolkit-for-ckb/4254).

### [Clover Protocol](https://github.com/sec-bit/clover-protocol)

An aSVC based stateless protocol as layer-2 rollup on Nervos network. Developed during the [Nervos hackathon](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/nervoshack-wrap-up-4370044f9866).

### [Learning ZKP](https://github.com/sec-bit/learning-zkp)

Articles, codes and tools all about zero-knowledge proofs. Read about zkp introduction series [from here](https://github.com/sec-bit/learning-zkp/blob/master/zkp-intro/1/zkp-back.md) or check out [zkp learning resource list](https://github.com/sec-bit/learning-zkp/blob/master/zkp-resource-list.md).

### [Token Libraries with Proofs](https://github.com/sec-bit/tokenlibs-with-proofs)

Correctness proofs of Ethereum token contracts.

### [Formal Verification for Decentralized Exchange](https://github.com/sec-bit/loopring-protocol2-verification)
