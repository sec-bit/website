We are SECBIT Labs. We aim to build high-confidence and trustworthy protocol, application, and facilities on the blockchain. We focus on the research of formal verification, practices of zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain security. We have explored the full formal verification for [token smart contracts](https://github.com/sec-bit/tokenlibs-with-proofs) and [decentralized exchanges](https://github.com/sec-bit/loopring-protocol2-verification) for the first time. We also have designed and implemented the [zkPoD](https://github.com/sec-bit/zkPoD-node), a practical decentralized protocol for data exchange. We reported [many buggy smart contracts](https://github.com/sec-bit/awesome-buggy-erc20-tokens) on Ethereum, including well-known Fomo3D [bugs](https://sec-bit.github.io/blog/2018/08/20/last-winner-of-lastwinner/) and [attack vectors](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-the-winner-got-fomo3d-prize-a-detailed-explanation-b30a69b7813f).
